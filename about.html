          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>With over a year of development experience in few technology of industries. I realized that the web designing is the field were I see my self in future, All too often developers rarely stick to a single technology 
            , resulting in a final few drop programming as there career, that fails to reach the goal sought by there dreams and end
            user.
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the prerequiste  specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the  goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
